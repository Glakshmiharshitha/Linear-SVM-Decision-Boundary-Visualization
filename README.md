# Linear-SVM-Decision-Boundary-Visualization
This Python script visualizes the decision boundaries created by a linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on the Iris dataset. It utilizes scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities and matplotlib for plotting. The code loads the Iris dataset, trains a linear SVC on the first two features (sepal length and sepal width)
